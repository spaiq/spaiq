# Hello, I'm BartÅ‚omiej Juszczyk ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software engineer with a keen interest in data structures and back-end development. Currently I'm a 3rd-year student at West Pomeranian University of Technology. Here's a brief overview of some of the projects I've been working on:

## ðŸš€ Projects

### [specfic-grep](https://github.com/spaiq/specfic-grep)
This repository is dedicated to the `specfic-grep` project, a specialized version of the `grep` command-line utility. It's written in C++ and showcases my ability to work with file I/O, regular expressions, and command-line interfaces in C++. More about this project can be found in the [README](https://github.com/spaiq/specfic-grep/blob/main/README.md).

### [CPP_BSTree](https://github.com/spaiq/CPP_BSTree)
This repository contains an implementation of a Binary Search Tree in C++. It's a great example of how data structures can be implemented in low-level languages. Check out the [README](https://github.com/spaiq/CPP_BSTree/blob/main/README.md) for more details.

### [CPP_HashTable](https://github.com/spaiq/CPP_HashTable)
Here, I've implemented a Hash Table in C++. This project showcases the power of hash tables in handling data efficiently. More about this project can be found in the [README](https://github.com/spaiq/CPP_HashTable/blob/main/README.md).

### [CPP_RBTree](https://github.com/spaiq/CPP_RBTree)
This repository is dedicated to the implementation of a Red-Black Tree in C++. Red-Black Trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree, and this project provides a deep dive into how they work. Check out the [README](https://github.com/spaiq/CPP_RBTree/blob/main/README.md) for more information.

### [doubly_linked_list](https://github.com/spaiq/doubly_linked_list)
This project is about implementing a doubly linked list. It's a fundamental data structure that forms the basis for understanding more complex structures. More details can be found in the [README](https://github.com/spaiq/doubly_linked_list/blob/main/README.md).

### [Meta-Back-End-Developer-Course](https://github.com/spaiq/Meta-Back-End-Developer-Course)
This repository contains most of the work I've done during my Back-End Developer Course. It covers a wide range of topics, from Python programming to web development. Check out the [README](https://github.com/spaiq/Meta-Back-End-Developer-Course/blob/main/README.md) for a detailed breakdown.

### [ZUT-fourth-semester-project](https://github.com/spaiq/ZUT-fourth-semester-project)
This is a project I worked on during my fourth semester at ZUT. It's a comprehensive project that allowed me to apply the skills I've learned throughout my course. More about this project can be found in the [README](https://github.com/spaiq/ZUT-fourth-semester-project/blob/main/README.md).
